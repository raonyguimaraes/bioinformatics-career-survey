# Biomedical Informatics Survey

## About

This project aims to understand the field of Biomedical Informatics by surveying the
people whom work in it. 

The questions of this project were based on the survey created in 2008 and repeated 
in 2012 for the field of Bioinformatics by Pierre Lindenbaum, Rob Syme and Larry Parnell.

I hope that in 10 years we will have enough data to see how professionals of both fields relates to each other.
